# Power Polygon
Power Polygon is the tool that will allow you to create impressive presentations with many different themes and transitions, based in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, running in your browser.<br/>
You can create a new theme, or customise an existing one. Also, creating new transitions is quite simple!<br/>

### Quick docs
To use it, just unzip it(or clone it) under a server(like apache) and access it in your browser.
But, if you want to use all the tools, you can use nodejs by running, in the unziped(or cloned) directory:

`$ npm install`

A token will be asked, type a word that you will not forget very easily.
Then, to run it, all you gotta do is:

`$ sudo node run.js`

Done, now, access <a href='http://localhost:8081/'>http://localhost:8081/</a>.
To create your talk, check the documentation below.
