<h2>Creating your talk</h2>
This will make Power Polygon look for your sections by IDs(they must match to your slides ids).<br/>
If a slide is not found, Power Polygon will try to load it from:<br/>
<strong>my-talk/slides/slide-id/slide-id.html</strong><br/>
This is how your tree will look like:<br/>
<div class="img-center">
    <img src="slides/create-your-talk-3/slide-tree.png" />
</div>
<strong style="color: red;">* </strong>Please notice that your external slides will <strong>NOT</strong> have the section element, just its content, once Power Polygon creates the containing section for each loaded slide.
